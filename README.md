# 🏷️ Titanic-Survival-Predictor

## 📜 Description

Titanic-Survival-Predictor is a machine learning project designed to predict passenger survival on the infamous Titanic voyage. Using historical passenger data, this model analyzes factors such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare to determine the likelihood of survival.

## 📌 Key Features

🚢 Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the Titanic dataset for training.

📊 Feature Engineering: Extracts meaningful features like passenger class, family size, and embarked location.

🤖 Machine Learning Models: Implements various ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).

📈 Performance Evaluation: Assesses model accuracy using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

🔍 Interactive Predictions: Allows users to input passenger details and get survival predictions.

## 📂 Dataset

This project is based on the Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster dataset from Kaggle.
